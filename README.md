A modular discord bot framework.

Discuss Discordful in my Discord server: [#discordful](https://discord.gg/BRN5x7W)

I currently dont accepts any pull requests for features while its still work in progress. If you have any fixes then be free to send one!
If you do send a pr, be sure to run `npm run lint` and fix some mistakes (I'm addicted to clean code).

## Goals:

* Programmed in node.js. It's easy to pick up, but fast and reliable.
* K.I.S.S: Keep It Stupidly Simple
* Advanced and simple solutions
* [Connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect)-like middleware plugins
* Built on top of [Discordie](https://github.com/qeled/discordie)
